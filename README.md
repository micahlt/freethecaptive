## What is a Captive Portal?

We've all been to restaurants, schools, or businesses that had seemingly "open" WiFi networks, only to open a browser and discover that a password is required.  These password pages are called Captive Portals, and while annoying, they are not in the slightest secure.  This script uses a technique known as MAC spoofing to bypass them and access the Internet.
